HTML5 Bombergirl
================

Bombergirl is a remake of a classic game known as Bomberman. You can play alone against the AI bots, but it also supports multiplayer, so you can play with your friend on the same computer.

The game is written entirely in JavaScript with help of [EaselJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS) library which makes working with canvas element easy. I've chosen this library because it is supported by Adobe and Microsoft and even Google has used it while creating [Find your way to Oz](http://www.findyourwaytooz.com/) Chrome experiment.

Developed after participating in [HTML5 Game Development (CS255)](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255) online class on [Udacity.com](http://udacity.com).
